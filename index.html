                Oda Nobunaga was a Japanese daimyo and one of the leading figures of the Sengoku period. 
                He is regarded as the first "Great Unifier" of Japan. His reputation in war gave him the nickname of "Demon Daimyo" or "Demon King".
                Nobunaga was an influential figure in Japanese history and is regarded as one of three great unifiers.
