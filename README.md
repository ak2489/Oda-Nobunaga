### Addition Features

* The colour scheme chosen is for easy of reading for the user with there being lots of information to digest. The cream background colour and blue text colour would also help users with Dyslexia.

### Features Left to Implement 

* I would have like to have broken the information up more, when the site is being used on 800px and smaller the infomation paragraphs are very large. 
* Also when using 800px screens and smaller the return to top button overlaps the youtube footer link. 


## Testing 

* I test this pages works on different browsers Chrome, Edge and Firefox.
* I confirm the site is responsive, looks good and functions on all standard screen sizes using devtools device toolbars. 
* I confirm that nav bar and all the text are all readable and easy to understand. 
* I confirm that all the links work and open up in new tabs. 

## Bugs 

* When I deployed my project I discovered that my project was broken, the links to the other files (CSS and images) did not work. 

* I discovered this was because I had used relative file paths such as in this code.
